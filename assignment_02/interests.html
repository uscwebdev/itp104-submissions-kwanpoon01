    <h1>Los Angeles Lakers</h1>

    <div id="main">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <img id="lakers_logo" src="lakers_logo.svg" alt="Lakers Logo">
        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are among the most successful franchises in NBA history. Since their inception as the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947, they have won 16 championships and appeared in 31 Finals series. The team has had some of the greatest players to ever play basketball, including Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O'Neal, who all helped bring multiple titles to LA during their time with the franchise. </p>
        <p>The team moved from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before beginning play for the 1960-61 season and instantly became a force on both ends of the court by winning five titles over six seasons (1980-85) behind Hall Of Famers like Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and James Worthy. In 2000 they added another championship, thanks mainly due to Shaq's presence inside, but it was not until Kobe arrived that things took off for them again as he led them to three more titles (2000-02).</p>
        <p>After an extended drought following Kobe’s retirement, LeBron James signed with LA before the 2018–19 season, which marked a new era for this legendary franchise culminating last year when Anthony Davis joined forces with Lebron James leading them back into contention once again resulting in 17th title win after beating Miami Heat 4 games out 5 in 2020 finals series. This historic victory made sure that Laker Nation will remain at the top among other teams competing against each other throughout this league long after these two superstars retire from the game itself, making it clear why so many fans across the world consider themselves part of something special here.</p>
